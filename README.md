# Transform your R Dataframes: Styles, 🎨 Colors, and 😎 Emojis

In this repository, we will explore a method to add 🎨colors and 🖌️styles in R DataFrames. We will focus on the application of colors and emojis, using approaches similar to the popular conditional formatting commonly used in pivot tables within spreadsheets. Through this strategy, we aim to improve the presentation of our data, making the exploration and understanding of the information not only informative but also visually attractive.
